For each of us, a beginning can be a big challenge. 
This is my beginning in web development. 
When we look at a picture of ourselves from the past, 
we sometimes tend to think that we were somewhat banal, ridiculous. 
Most of the time we consider the current moment as a moment of evolution. 
I am glad that I have the opportunity to capture this moment. I want to grow a lot. 
I know that this means a lot of work but I want to go back to this moment, to this first website and exclaim: 
"Wow, how much I have evolved since then". See you soon!
